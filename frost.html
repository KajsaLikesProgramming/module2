  <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1> 
  <h2>Robert Frost (1874-1963)</h2> 
  <main>
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    </p>
    
    <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there<br>
    Had worn them really about the same,
    </p>
    
    <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
    In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
    I doubted if I should ever come back.
    </p>    
    
    <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
    I took the one less traveled by,<br>
    And that has made all the difference.
